WIP Airtable API client for Lua
</div>

## Features

- We aim to support **all** Airtable API features natively
- Built in protection against Airtable injections
- Support for modifying/getting records using field values, not just record IDs

## Installation

Airlua requires [Astra](https://astra.arkforge.net/), a modern lua runtime with built in support for HTTP requests, and many other useful functions. Astra allows Airlua to be 100% written in Lua.

Once you have Astra installed, simply download airtable.lua and add it to your project folder. (Luarocks support coming soon)
